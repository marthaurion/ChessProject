An online 2-player chess game written in Java.

The GameServer class has a main function that is running on my home computer. The client classes are hardcoded to connect to my IP. The Test class has the main function for the clients.
The server pairs up two connections and creates a game between them. They then pass moves back and forth until the game ends.
